### Word frequency counter in R and Python

#### Motivation for this mini-project
 
I needed a way to get word frequency information from a chunk of text.
 
#### About the code

Both scripts read a .txt file containing typical text (with punctuation, newlines, etc.) and output a table containing all unique words found in the text, along with their counts. The table is sorted by word frequency, from most to least frequent. 

The R code was tested in 4.0.4. The Python code was tested in 3.7.6.
